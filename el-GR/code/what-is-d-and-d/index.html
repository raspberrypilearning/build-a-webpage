      <h2>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
      <p>According to the company who makes it, Wizard of the Coast, it's the <strong>World's greatest role-playing game</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So what's a role-playing game? It's where you and your friends sit around pretending to be characters you made up, in a fantasy world created by the Dungeonmaster (DM for short). Your character can do anything you can imagine, and when you interact with the world, you roll some dice to determine the outcome or reaction to your actions.</p>

      <h2>The Dungeonmaster (DM)</h2>
        <p class=tertiary>If D&D was like a video game, the DM is the console you play it on - they bring the world to life for you and determine how it reacts to your actions and the actions of the other players.</p>
        <br>
        <p class=tertiary>The DM portrays and decides the actions of all the other characters who inhabit the world, who are not controlled by the players. They resolve actions, determine outcomes and tell the story to the group of what is happening around them. The DM knows everything about the world, and what they don't know about it, they can just make up!</p>
        <br>
        <p class=tertiary>Whatever the DM says goes, as they are the referee, narrator and other characters all rolled into one!</p>

  <h2>Classes</h2>
  </div>
  
<p><strong>Classes</strong> are the way your character behaves in the game <strong>mechanically</strong>, or what abilities or skills they have and special tricks they can do. Mighty warriors for example, are better at fighting with weapons and strength, while clever wizards use their magical studies to create mighty spells.</p> <br>
<p>Classes come in two kinds: <strong>Martial classes</strong> which focus on combat and non-magical skills, and <strong>Spellcasting Classes</strong> which focus on affecting the world around them with magical means. </p> <br>
<p>Below is a selection of just <strong>some</strong> of the available classes in Dungeons and Dragons:</p>
