## Introduction

In this project you will use the skills you have developed in the [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path to create a webpage about something you want to share. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">World Wide Web</span> or <span style="color: #0faeb0">web</span> is a vast collection of connected webpages. The web allows people to view content from all over the world and create their own webpages to share with others. Can you imagine what life was like before the web?
</p>

You will:
+ Build a webpage to share information with others
+ Create a webpage using multiple sections with a variety of HTML elements
+ Use and customise or add CSS classes to style your page

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">
Can you identify the HTML elements that are used in this project? How has CSS been used to style and animate the page?

### PROJECT BRIEF: Build a webpage
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create a webpage about a topic that you find interesting and want to share with others. It could be helpful information for pet owners, a page of your favourite jokes, a walkthrough for a game you enjoy, some advice you have found helpful, a list of useful websites, or whatever you want to share with webpage visitors.

Your webpage should:
+ Have multiple sections that contain different types of content including text and images, emojis, headings, quotations, lists, or links
+ Use a colour palette, fonts, and CSS styles that work well together
+ Be accessible by using good colour contrast and font sizes

Your webpage could:
+ Use custom CSS classes that you create and apply
+ Use animations or flip cards to create interest
+ Be shared to the Raspberry Pi Foundation community gallery to inspire others
