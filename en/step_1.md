<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">world wide web**</span> or <span style="color: #0faeb0">web</span> is a vast collection of connected web pages. The web allows people to view content from all over the world and create their own web pages to share with others. Can you imagine what life was like before the web?

### PROJECT BRIEF: Project title
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create a web page about a topic that you find interesting and want to share with others. It could be helpful information for pet owners, a page of your favourite jokes, a walkthrough for a game you enjoy, some advice you have found helpful, a list of useful web sites, or whatever you want to share with web page visitors.

Your web page should:
+ Have multiple sections containing different kinds of content including text and images or emoji, headings, quotations, lists or links
+ Use a colour palette, fonts and CSS styles that work well together
+ Be accessible by using good colour contrast and font sizes

You web page could:
+ Use custom CSS classes that you create and apply
+ Use animations or flip cards to create interest
+ Be shared to the Raspberry Pi Foundation community gallery to inspire others
