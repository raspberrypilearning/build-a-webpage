### What do you want to share?

Think about the purpose of your webpage.

It could be:

+ ℹ️ An information page about a topic you are interested in
+ 🔗 A collection of links to the best webpages on a topic
+ 🧧 Information about a celebration or an event from your culture
+ 😜 Your favourite (polite!) jokes
+ 🎮 A game walkthrough or other tutorial
+ 🐙 Information about a pet or an animal
+ 💬 Some advice that you have found helpful
+ 🏞️ Tourist information about a place you have visited or would like to visit
+ 👩🏿‍🦼 Information about a medical condition or disability that you think more people should be aware of 

**Tip:** Try to choose a topic that you already know something about. This is so you can spend your time building your webpage, not researching a topic.
