## Build and test

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now it's time to build your web page. 

</div>
<div>

</div>
</div>

**Tip:** Plan your project so you will be able to create a basic web page in the time you have available and then upgrade the project if you have time left. 

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.
