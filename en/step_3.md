**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your HTML or CSS that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

---
title: Incorrect tags or properties
---

Carefully check the spelling of your HTML tags, attributes and classes. 

This example incorrectly uses 'image' instead of 'img'! `<img>` is the correct HTML tag. 

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<image class="bordered-box" src="happy.png" alt="An outline of an anime style girl with a happy facial expression."/>

--- /code ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: Mismatched tags or brackets
---

Make sure that tags with an open and close tag such as `<div>` and `</div>` are correctly matched and nested.

This HTML is incorrect because there is no closing `</div>` tag. 

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---
<section>
<div><p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</section>
--- /code ---

This HTML is incorrect because the `</div>` appears before the closing `</p>` tag.

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<div><p>Lorem ipsum</div></p>

--- /code ---

**Tip:** If your HTML is incorrect then sometimes a web browser will work out what you meant. You should still make sure your HTML is correct as incorrect HTML might cause problems later and make make it difficult for screen readers to understand your page.

title: My image isn't displayed
---

Check carefully that the name of your image in the `src` property matches the file name. This includes making sure that use of capital letters is the same. 'myimage.png' is *not* the same as 'myimage.PNG'.

This HTML will not display an image saved as 'happy.PNG':

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<img src="happy.png" alt="An outline of an anime style girl with a happy facial expression."/>

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: My font isn't displayed
---

When you want to use a new google font, you need to make sure you have:

+ Added the `<link>` from google fonts to the `<head>` section of your web page
+ Updated the font variables in `default.css` or the style sheet that you are using for your colour and font palette. 

This example adds the `Bangers` font and uses if for headers and titles, but not for the body:

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<!-- Import fonts from Google -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bangers&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

--- /code ---

--- code ---
---
language: CSS
filename: default.css
line_numbers: false
---

--body-font: 1.1rem Verdana, sans-serif;
--header-font: lighter 3rem 'Bangers', cursive;
--title-font: lighter 2rem 'Bangers', cursive;

--- /code ---
