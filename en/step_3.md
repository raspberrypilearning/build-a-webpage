## Build and test

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now it's time to build your webpage. 

</div>
<div>
![alt=""](images/step-three.PNG){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

**Tip:** Plan your project so you can create a basic webpage in the time you have available and then upgrade the project if you have time left. 

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

[[[full-width-section]]]

[[[full-width-quote]]]

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Webpages can be viewed on many different devices and should be <span style="color: #0faeb0">**responsive**</span> to each device. This means that if a user views your website on a mobile phone, it should respond to a smaller screen and if they view it on a desktop PC, it should respond to a larger screen.

CSS can also be used to responsively change the layout of the webpage.

**Test:** Show someone else your project and get their feedback. Do you want to make any changes to your webpage? 

If you have a Trinket account, you can click on the 'Remix' button to save a copy to your My Trinkets library.

If you don’t have a Trinket account, you can still come back to your project in the future on the same computer by using the starter project link.

You can also publish your saved project to see what it would look like as a full webpage. Each time you save your project, your published site is updated.

[[[trinket-publish-project]]]

**Tip:** To make sure your webpage can be viewed by people with disabilities and that it appeals to a wide audience, you need to make sure it is accessible.

[[[check-accessibility]]]

**Tip:** Now is a good time to add comments to your code to make it easier to debug and upgrade. Comments also help other people read you code.
