## Build and test

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now it's time to build your webpage. 

</div>
<div>
![alt=""](images/step-three.PNG){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

**Tip:** Plan your project so you can create a basic webpage in the time you have available and then upgrade the project if you have time left. 

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

[[[full-width-quote]]]

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Webpages can be viewed on many different devices and should be <span style="color: #0faeb0">**responsive**</span> to each device. This means that if a user views your website on a mobile phone, it should respond to a smaller screen and if they view it on a desktop PC, it should respond to a larger screen.
